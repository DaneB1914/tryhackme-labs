# TryHackMe — Junior Penetration Tester Labs

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through the **Junior Penetration Tester** path on TryHackMe.  
The focus is on understanding *how and why* vulnerabilities occur, not just how to exploit them.

Each write-up reflects practical penetration testing concepts, real-world impact, and defensive considerations.

## 🔍 Core Web Security Labs

These labs focus on some of the most common and impactful web application vulnerabilities seen during real penetration tests.

### 🔐 Authentication Bypass
**Topic:** Broken authentication and logic flaws  
**Key concepts:**
- Missing or inconsistent authentication checks  
- Flawed authentication workflows  
- Server-side enforcement vs client-side assumptions  

📄 Write-up: `web-hacking/authentication-bypass.md`

---

### 🔑 IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
**Topic:** Broken access control / authorization  
**Key concepts:**
- Trusting user-controlled object identifiers  
- Authentication vs authorization  
- Object-level access control failures  

📄 Write-up: `web-hacking/idor.md`

---

### 🧪 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Topic:** Client-side trust and input handling  
**Key concepts:**
- Improper input handling and output encoding  
- Context-dependent exploitation  
- Real-world browser-based impact  

📄 Write-up: `web-hacking/intro-to-xss.md`

## 🧠 Methodology & Approach

Across these labs, I follow a structured penetration testing mindset:
1. Understand application behavior
2. Identify user input and trust boundaries
3. Test authentication and authorization logic
4. Validate impact
5. Document findings clearly with remediation guidance

This mirrors how web penetration testing is performed in real consulting and internal security assessments.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in web application penetration testing  
- Practice clear, professional documentation  
- Develop a consistent methodology aligned with real-world pentesting  

This repository will continue to grow as I progress through additional penetration testing labs and modules.
